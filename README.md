Microsoft Azure Blob Storage integration for Laravel's Storage API

# Installation

Install the package using composer:

```bash
composer require steffjenl/laravel-azure-blob-storage
```

On Laravel versions before 5.5 you also need to add the service provider to `config/app.php` manually:

```php
    SteffjeNL\LaravelAzureBlobStorage\AzureBlobStorageServiceProvider::class,
```

Then add this to the `disks` section of `config/filesystems.php`:

```php
        'azure' => [
            'driver'    => 'azure',
            'name'      => env('AZURE_STORAGE_NAME'),
            'key'       => env('AZURE_STORAGE_KEY'),
            'container' => env('AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER'),
        ],
```

Finally, add the fields `AZURE_STORAGE_NAME`, `AZURE_STORAGE_KEY` and `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER` to your `.env` file with the appropriate credentials. Then you can set the `azure` driver as either your default or cloud driver and use it to fetch and retrieve files as usual.

Constructing a URL
------------------

This driver doesn't support the `Storage::url($path)` method, and adding support as a third-party package doesn't appear to be practical. However, you can construct a URL to retrieve the asset as follows:

```php
$url = 'https://' . config('filesystems.disks.azure.name'). '.blob.core.windows.net/' . config('filesystems.disks.azure.container') . '/' . $filename;
```

You may want to create a helper function for this.
